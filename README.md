# GatherUpWeb-React
Event attendance tracker web app for Purdue's Office of International Programs, containing abilities to create, view, update, delete events, as well as downloading csv files to view all attendees.

### Getting Started
1. Download the latest Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Download the latest Git from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
  - If you are Windows user, make sure you check getting git bash while you install
3. Open up terminal (command prompt for windows), cd to the directory (like Documents, Downloads, Desktop, whatever you want) that you want to store this project. Here are the tutorials for [terminal](https://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/mac-software/how-use-terminal-on-mac-3608274/) and [command prompt](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/windows-command-prompt-introduction/) if you don't have a clue how to use them.
4. Type in the following command to clone down the project

 `git clone git@github.com:purdue-epics-ims/GatherUpWeb-React.git`

 If you fail cloning:
  - Check your permission to the project with your team leader
  - Check if you have added the ssh key of your computer to Github, if not, follow [this tutorial to create a new ssh-key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/) and [this tutorial to add your ssh-key to Github ](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/)

5. cd into GatherUpWeb-React after you finish cloning
6. (Optional) Type in the following command to get yarn (trust me, yarn is A LOT faster and fancier than npm):

  `npm install -g yarn`

7. Type in the following command to download all the libraries for the project with yarn:

  `yarn`

  or if you are using npm, do this:

  `npm install`

8. Finally, you can run the project with the following command if you are using yarn:

  `yarn start`

  or if you are using npm, do this:

  `npm start`

  PROFIT!

### Software to Use for Development

- [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as text editor, make sure you download packages (such as language-babel, eslint, etc.) for react development after you install these editors
- (Optional) [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) nice and free git client if you hate using terminal and github client
- (Optional) [Adobe XD](http://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html) for mockup development (you know what to do if you don't want to pay for it)
